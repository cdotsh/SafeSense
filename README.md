# SafeSense: Lightweight, portable network security monitor for public Wi-Fi protection

SafeSense is a compact, ESP32-based tool designed to help everyday users detect malicious activities on public Wi-Fi networks. This project aims to protect users from common network attacks, such as ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and other man-in-the-middle threats, providing real-time alerts to enhance digital safety on-the-go. SafeSense is easy to set up, requires minimal technical knowledge, and can be used as a security companion when connecting to unsecured or public Wi-Fi.
